# Optical Character Recogniton 

When I  started with Machine Learning, one of the most basic examples is the MNIST dataset. Almost every course employed this dataset to teach students about some important concepts successfuly. So, I wanted to use that dataset in a different way to see how much I learnt. And I am proud to say the now I have successfully employed those concepts in a real world usage scenario.

This OCR displays a Tkinter GUI window with a canvas. The user can draw on the canvas and be provided with real time recognition of the drawn characters.

## The usage details and details of various files will be uploaded in a few days once I have fixed the few remaining bugs.

## Attention:
** This OCR works only on single characters or words in which the characters are seperated by spaces. It is not able to detect cursive handwriting yet. I was working on it but I was not able to accurately segment characters with open loops like 'u', 'm', 'w' etc. The segmentation was on point for closed loop characters like 'a', 'd' f', 'o' etc. **
